== Interests
I aim to improve *programming languages* to enhance *performance* and provide stronger guarantees for users.
Designing and implementing *optimizations* in compilers for programming languages has been my lifelong pursuit.

== Projects

#entry(
    tl: [*Calocom* #link("https://github.com/permui/calocom")[#fa-link()] _Rust_],
    tr: [*Spring 2022*],
)[
- This is a group project for course _Compilation Principles_.
- A feature-rich programming language with *algebraic data types*, high order functions, and pattern matching.
- I was involved in designing the *type system*, typed AST, the memory representation of objects,
  the style of name mangling, and a middle IR that provides an intermediary level for desugaring and other necessary transformations.
- I led the development of this project. I implemented almost all components (except for lexing & parsing),
  including syntax desugaring, *semantics checking*, *closure conversion*,  *LLVM*-based *code lowering* with Rust library _inkwell_.
  I also wrote standard libraries (strings, vectors, etc.) and *runtime* (objects allocation and program entry point) in unsafe Rust.
- Best course project in my class.

#entry(
    tl: [*SyOC* #link("https://github.com/waterlens/syoc")[#fa-link()] _C++, Python, ARM_],
    tr: [*Spring 2022 - Summer 2022*],
)[
- A hobby project with my friend for learning compiler optimization techniques and participating in Bisheng Cup Compiler Contest. 
  We wrote the project from scratch and were the first team (2 people) from ZJU to enter the final round of the contest.
- I led the development of this project.
  I designed the basic *compiler framework* for performing optimization transformations with C++ templates,
  and a *SSA*-based intermediate representation with *def-use* and *use-def* chains.
- I implemented the lexer, the recursive descent parser, the *mem2reg* pass
  (including *immediate dominator analysis* and *iterated domination frontier analysis* for SSA construction),
  dead code elimination, and constant propagation.
- I wrote a Python script for comparing the performance of the optimized program with gcc or other compilers.

#entry(
    tl: [*QuicKaml* #link("https://github.com/waterlens/quickaml")[#fa-link()] _C_],
    tr: [*Autumn 2023*],
)[
- A hobby project that implements a *register-based VM* interpreter of a monomorphic language and engineered many low-level optimizations.
- I patched LLVM with special *calling conventions* to generate
  efficient code for the handler of VM instructions in interpreter using *guaranteed tail-calls*.
- I tried multiple techniques to improve the performance of the interpreter, including:
  *operands reordering* to allow more efficient sign-extension; *partial register decoding* to reduce
  unnecessary shifts on x86-64 architecture; instruction fetching based on unaligned memory access
  or shifting & masking; *pre-decoding* before dispatching to exploit the CPU pipelines.

#entry(
    tl: [*MLscript* #link("https://github.com/waterlens/mlscript")[#fa-link()] _Scala, C++_],
    tr: [*Autumn 2023 - Now*],
)[
- A joint project from my lab.
- I designed a *ANF*-based intermediate representation with join points extension.
- I implemented a *smart inliner* with control flow analysis to identify when to make inlining decisions,
  and leverage *function splitting* technique to minimize the code duplication brought by inlining.
  I am also responsible for the implementation of the C++ backend,
  which features a universal memory representation for objects,
  *optimized arithmetic operations on unboxed values*,
  and *reference-counting*-based memory management.

#entry(
    tl: [*MMM* #link("https://github.com/Mini-Moonbit-Machine/mmm")[#fa-link()] _MoonBit, RISC-V, WebAssembly_],
    tr: [*Autumn 2024*]
)[
- A joint project with my friend for the MGPIC contest. Won 1st place and had an absolute advantage over 2nd place.
- I led the development and designed an optimizing compiler
  framework in MoonBit for the _Mini MoonBit_ language with JS, *RISC-V* and *WASM* backends.
- I implemented all essential optimizations for the contest, including *guaranteed tail recursion elimination*,
  *selective lambda lifting* based on *register pressure*,
 *basic block straightening*, dead code elimination,
  *local value numbering*, *common subexpression elimination*,
  *loop invariants code motion*, *jump table optimizations*,
  *scalar replacement*, and fast bump allocating.
- I wrote the code generators for JavaScript and RISC-V backend.
  To avoid stack overflow, I devised a *selective CPS transformation* and *automatic thunking* on function calls
  in the JavaScript backend. In the RISC-V backend, I ported a *tree-pattern covering instruction selector* from Cranelift,
  and implemented a *chordal graph coloring register allocator*.
- I extended the language with parametric polymorphism (*generics*),
  ad-hoc polymorphism (*typeclass*, implemented through dictionary-passing),
  and user-defined operators.

#entry(
    tl: [*RMatch* #link("https://github.com/waterlens/rmatch")[#fa-link()] _C++_],
    tr: [*Autumn 2021*],
)[
- A personal hobby project that parses *regular expressions* and generates NFA-based *virtual machine* bytecode.
  The bytecode is then *JIT*-compiled to native x86-64 machine instructions with C++ library _xbyak_.

    tl: [*Apple Î¼Arch Bench* #link("https://github.com/waterlens/apple-uarch-bench")[#fa-link()] _C_],
    tr: [*Spring 2024*],

  counters*.

    tl: [*SIB Optimization for OCaml* #link("https://github.com/waterlens/ocaml/pull/1")[#fa-link()] _OCaml_],
    tr: [*Spring 2025*],
)[
- _Share-immutable-block_ optimization.
  Functional programming languages frequently perform pattern matching on existing data structures.
  Even if the new object created is identical to the old one, a new object is often allocated.
  I implemented a sound optimization that eliminates this unnecessary allocation if the object is proven to be immutable.
- This optimization is internally used in the MoonBit compiler.

    tl: [*Monoid Hash* #link("https://github.com/waterlens/monoid-hash/blob/fcf87700c1145429097045e3a29cc2db8230ae22/crc32c.h#L76")[#fa-link()] _C, AArch64_],
    tr: [*Spring 2025*],
)[
- The performance critical part of an ongoing research project on incremental computation.
- I extended the fast-crc32 implementation with hardware-accelerated monoid
  combination using ARMv8's `pmull` instructions.
  Specifically, this acceleration involves speeding up the multiplication
  of two bit-reflected polynomials over the $"GF"(2^32)$ field.

== Experience

#entry(

)[
  - I implemented an OCaml optimization that improves the performance of the MoonBit compiler.
  - I improved the speed of compiling the MoonBit test when using the native backend
    by using the `tcc` compiler to compile generated C source, which involved a refactoring
    of build system, fixing bugs in `tcc` compiler, and cross-platform (Linux, macOS, Windows)
    support for runtime library of MoonBit.
  - I added the benchmark feature to the toolchain with statistical analysis and visualization.

    To ensure the privacy of the students' code, I devised an approach to require students use a public key to encrypt their code
    before submitting their code as a GitHub issue.
