== RESEARCH INTEREST
I'm interested in the *design* and *implementation* of programming languages and typing systems.

#set list(indent: 15pt)
- This is a course project where I and my teammates designed and implemented a programming language with functional features like algebraic data type, closure, and pattern matching.
- I was involved in designing the type system, the typed AST, and the middle IR.
- I wrote the type checker, transformer from typed AST to middle IR, the code generator targeting LLVM IR, the run-time library, and the standard library.

#set list(indent: 15pt)
- An optimizing compiler for SysY (a subset of C) language.
- Used technique: Iterated domination frontier analysis for SSA-form IR construction, constant propagation, etc.

== EXPERIENCE

#entry(
    tl: [*Teaching Assistant*],
    tr: [*Sept. 2022 - Jan. 2023*],
)[
#set list(indent: 15pt)
- In the course _Principles of Programming Languages_.
- I prepared a lab that requires students to implement Hindleyâ€“Milner type inference in a simple lambda calculus with let expression.
- I designed and wrote the auto judgement system of labs.
